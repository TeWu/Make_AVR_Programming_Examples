Electronic components required to build example circuits:

* 3 x LED (any color)
* 3 x current limiting resistor for LED (~1-2k ohm)
* Photoresistor
* Potentiometer + resistor (sensible values to create a voltage divider)
* Push-button
* USB to Serial (USART) adapter
* Speaker + Decoupling capacitor (~100nF)
* Piece of wire for radio antenna
* Chip that can communicate via SPI - e.g. EEPROM memory chip
* Chip that can communicate via TWI (a.k.a I2C) - e.g. AVR MCU
